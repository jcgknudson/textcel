#TODO: 
#Come up with some sort of character escaping scheme for including commas in texts
#	Figure out first how conversations are exported
#	Could simply reconstruct the message with commas inserted]
#
#Determine which methods should be static
#	We could have *every* method be static, and simply have a wrapper instance function that
#	passes (for example) a long list of times or texts to a static analysis function.
#	Or perhaps a hybrid of the two? Each function may be a static or instance function on a case-by-case basis
#	What are the pros and cons of each approach?
#
#Come up with a cohesive naming scheme for static/util/instance methods 
#
#Come up with a more intuitive way of organizing functions rather than conversation/etc.
#
#Refactor the below class into a "Conversation" object; enable an "Analyzer" class to process
#	multiple conversation objects
#
#Add decent input verification
#
#Add some way to responsibly raise and handle errors (i.e. window errors)
