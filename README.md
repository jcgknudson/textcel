# Textcel

This is a text analysis app meant for those who are

1. Insecure about the status of their LDR
2. Worrying if they're a so-called 'peripheral friend'
3. Worrying about (1) or (2) but they consider themselves the perpetrator
4. Simply curious about their texting habits (or someone else's)

If you fall into these categories then this project may be interesting to you

Textcel is a project that offers simple metadata about text conversations and analyzes things like:

* Unique word count
* Most common words
* u vs you
* ur vs your
* Sent/received text ratio
* Average number of texts sent before response

This list is nonexhaustive and will change, and we are more then open to suggestions, feedback, or comments

Currently, we are developing Textcel as a simple command-line utility which will be able to read CSV records of text conversations
