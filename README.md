# Textcel

This is a text analysis app meant for those who are curious about their texting habits (or someone else's)

Textcel is a project that offers simple metadata about text conversations and analyzes things like:

* Unique word count
* Most common words
* u vs you
* ur vs your
* Sent/received text ratio
* Average number of texts sent before response

This list is nonexhaustive and will change, and we are more than open to suggestions, feedback, or comments

Currently, we are developing Textcel as a simple command-line utility which will be able to read CSV records of text conversations
